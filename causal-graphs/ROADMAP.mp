# 🗺️ Roadmap: From Causal Graphs to Causal Hypergraphs

> **"Graphs capture causality. Hypergraphs capture context."**
>
> The future of causal computation lies in expanding beyond trees and graphs into **hypergraph topology** — where reasoning spans multiple dimensions at once.

## 🌲 Phase 1 — Causal Graphs (Today)

* **Structure:** Directed acyclic graphs of primitives (Connector, Processor, Monitor, etc.)
* **Unit:** Edge = single cause → effect
* **Focus:** Deterministic pipelines, auditable reasoning
* **Analogy:** Git for logic (commits = causal steps, DAG = history)

💡 **Goal:** Establish primitives and runtime across domains (econ, physics, bio).

---

## 🌉 Phase 2 — Causal Hypergraphs

* **Structure:**

  * Nodes may have **multi-way edges** (n inputs → m outputs simultaneously).
  * Supports **many-to-many causality** (e.g., feedback loops, ecosystems, networks).

* **Why:**

  * Real-world systems (markets, ecosystems, neural circuits) aren’t strictly DAGs.
  * Need to model **emergence, simultaneity, and entanglement**.

* **Example:**

  * Economics: interest rate shifts affect housing, currency, equities all at once.
  * Biology: a mutation can alter protein folding, metabolism, and immune response simultaneously.

💡 **Goal:** Extend primitives to allow **hyperedges** (k-ary relations, not just binary).

## 🔺 Phase 3 — Topological Reasoning

* **Structure:**

  * Treat causal graphs as **topological spaces**.
  * Map invariants (loops, holes, boundaries) using algebraic topology.

* **Why:**

  * Provides a language for **robustness and fragility**.
  * Lets us measure **global properties** of reasoning systems, not just local steps.

* **Example:**

  * Finance: detect systemic risk as a **hole in the liquidity manifold**.
  * Physics: conservation laws as **topological invariants**.
  * Biology: resilience of ecosystems as **homology groups**.

💡 **Goal:** Develop a **topological calculus for causality** — making reasoning geometrically auditable.

## 🌌 Phase 4 — Unified Causality OS

* **Universal Substrate:**

  * EDTs → Graphs → Hypergraphs → Topologies.
  * One runtime, many domains.

* **Domain-Specific Alphabets:**

  * Economics: volatility, arbitrage, incentives.
  * Physics: energy, entropy, invariants.
  * Biology: mutation, adaptation, ecology.

* **Vision:**

  * A **universal hypergraph runtime** where economics, physics, and biology can interoperate.
  * **AI-native reasoning substrate** for any discipline.
  * Portable, verifiable, composable — the Git for causality, the HTML for reasoning.

## 🧭 Next Steps

* [ ] Spec for **hyperedges** (multi-input / multi-output primitives)
* [ ] Visual tooling for **hypergraph editors**
* [ ] Experiments in **algebraic topology + causal graphs**
* [ ] Integrate with **ledger hashing** for topological audit trails

🔮 **Long-Term Dream:**
A **Causal Topology Engine** where reasoning is geometry — not just logic.
Where AI, humans, and systems share one fabric: **causal hypergraphs embedded in topology.**
